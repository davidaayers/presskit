history: 
  - header: "Early history"
    text: "Hi! I'm David, one of the founders of Furiously Inactive Games.  This all started when I was 13 and I got my first computer, a Vic-20.  I  saved up all of my Christmas and birthday money and paid for it myself.  I taught myself Basic, got a subscription to Compute's Gazzette and typed in all of the programs that were published there, then started making my own game. When Basic wasn't fast enough, I taught myself assembler. Even then, I was a giant nerd. Alas, my career pulled me in a different direction and I ultimately ended up working in corporate software development, building eCommerce systems and point of sale solutions, which has been super interesting and tons of fun."

    text: "I met Nik, and we decided we should work on games together. We started messing around with j2me and phone
        games, and helped our friends at Klear Games build an online game for the movie &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; (a game whose popularity far
        outlasted the movie's run in the theaters).  We worked on, but never fully finished many games. We did some game jams and some contests. Then I got married, and lo and behold my lovely new wife's brother, Ray, turned out to be an excellent artist, and we finally had 
        all of the ingredients to actually make a game.  For the last several years we have been working on &quot;We Slay Monsters&quot;, and it has
        been a wild ride."
